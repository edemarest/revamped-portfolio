    "text": "Hi, I’m Ella Demarest—a full-stack developer, artist, and creative problem solver. I’m passionate about building robust web applications, experimenting with AI/ML, and creating digital art. My journey spans bioinformatics, game development, and health tech. I’ve studied and worked in Boston and New York, and after spending a summer in NYC during my Regeneron internship, I fell in love with another city while also realizing how much Boston feels like home. I’m still deciding where I’ll settle—but I know I thrive in communities full of innovation, collaboration, and creativity."
