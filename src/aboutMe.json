"text": "I’m Ella, originally from San Diego and now based in Boston. I thrive in energetic, creative places and love building things—apps, interfaces, and new tech. My projects range from conversational engines at Northeastern’s IoT Lab to full-stack development at Regeneron and bioinformatics at Remix Therapeutics. Outside of work, I walk everywhere playing Pokémon Go (level 50!), explore new neighborhoods, and balance fitness with a weekly dessert ritual. I’m happiest when I’m building and making each week an adventure."
