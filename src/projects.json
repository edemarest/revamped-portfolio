          "details": "RBLXStats (also referred to as RBLXRank) is a full-stack analytics platform for Roblox developers. The system performs hourly sampling of player counts for tracked games, stores raw samples for 90 days, and compacts data into daily/weekly/monthly rollups for long-term trends. Tracking states (Tracking, Following, Archived) control sampling and quota usage. Key features: shared sampling to avoid duplicate API calls when multiple users track the same game, precomputed daily aggregates for fast dashboards, system metrics (coverage, freshness, sample count), and an engagement rating computed as (AvgPlaying / Visits in 24h) × 100%.\n\nYou can view the live site at https://rblxstats.live.\n\nAn AI agent (presented as an anime-style assistant) can analyze a game's performance and surface strengths and concerns when a 24-hour sampling window is available — it highlights retention issues, momentum shifts, and suggestions for improvements.\n\nTech highlights: React 18 + TypeScript frontend (Vite), Node.js + Express backend (TypeScript), PostgreSQL 15 with monthly partitioning for experience_metrics, node-postgres driver, background hourly sampling workers, Docker Compose deployment, and Chart.js for visualizations. Designed for efficient API usage, predictable retention, and quick API responses backed by nightly rollups.",
